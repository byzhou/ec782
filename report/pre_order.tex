\section{Design Work Flow}
The transceiver design in the RF area is largely determined by the gain, noise
figurer, cost and other aspects. These needs to be considered in the entire
design. Usually, the link budget estimation, which determines how much designers
are going to pay for the entire design and how much gain the entire receiver is
going to have.
Thus, the entire receiver design flow follows the steps below:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Estimation the specs of the entire design} \\
            The receiver front end will pick up the signal almost $2-3$ meters
            from the transmitter front end. Thus the signal is going to decade
            almost $40-60$dB as the signal is transmitting through the air. The
            following equation shows the estimation of receiver front-end signal
            signal power, as in the Equ.~\ref{power_est}.
            \begin{equation}
                P_{R} = \phi_{R}A_{e}=\frac{P_{T}}{4\pi R^2}A_{e}
                \label{power_est}
            \end{equation}
            $\phi_{R}$ is the free-space signal density, which follows a rule of
            quadrature loss. $A_{e}$ is the efficiency of the antenna
            (\textit{Power reflections have not been taken into consideration.})
            $P_{T}$ is the radiated power from the transmitter. $R$ is the
            distance from the transmitter to the receiver. After the
            calculation, the estimation of the signal strength that can be
            picked up by the receiver is $-60dBm$.
        \item \textit{Architecture Desicision} \\
            The entire design is to down-converting the signal from $1GHz$ to
            $IF$ frequency and then the FM signal being demoduled by the
            demodulator. The possible choices of the demodulation architecture
            are mainly decided by the demodulator. Since in the datasheet of
            \textit{SA636}, the details of the application circuits are very
            detailed. Thus the demodulator from our design is \textit{SA636}. It
            is using both $I/Q$ signal in the design. Therefore, in the design,
            a-$90$-degree phase shift is needed. But this has also been designed
            by the application circuit. So the only part the designer needs to
            worry about is to downconverting the signal from $1GHZ$ to the
            frequency that $SA636$ can be demodulated. In this case, the
            frequency is $100MHz$.

                \end{center}
            \end{figure}
        \item \textit{Main Components} \\
            Once all the specs have been determined, the designer should choose
            the main components from the websites like \textit{Digikey}, to see
            whether they are available. The first part is to choose the main
            components that my affect the entire design. These components
            include LNA, mixer, demodulator.

            designs. The brief list of the other components is below.

\section{Main Components Selections}
    \subsection{Low Noise Amplifier}
        Low Noise Amplifier is one of the most critical components in the entire
        design. Since the FM receiver performance is mainly decided by the SNR,
        which consists of signal strength and noise figure. The noise figure of
        a cascading system is mainly decided by the first several stages. In
        most of the communication system, the first several stages are consists
        of LNA and filters. In this case, we did not apply an RF filter in the
        front end, thus the filter noise figure has not been taken
        consideration, according to Equ.~\ref{cascading}.
        \begin{equation}
            Noise Figure = F_{1} + \frac{F_{2} - 1}{G_{1}} + \frac{F_{3} -
            1}{G_{1}G_{2}} + ...
            \label{cascading}
        \end{equation}
        The choice for the LNA highly depends on the noise figure and the gain.
        Since Analog Devices Inc.'s ADL5521 provides detailed information of
        application of the low noise amplifier, we choose it for our design. The
        application circuit gives detailed information of the bias circuit and
        the input impedance matching. The data sheet provides the suggestions of
        the each components value at different frequencies. The specs of ADL5521
        is listed below.

    \subsection{Filter}
        Since the RF filter is not needed in this project, the only filter that
        we need is the IF filter that can filter out the mirror signal higher
        than the local oscillary frequency. We choose the oscillator at 890MHz,
        which can also be tuned from 800MHz to 1GHz. The IF filter is at 100MHz
        and it is a passband filter. We use the custome way of filter design and
        use lumped elements to build the filter.

                Spec & Value \\ \\ \hline \\
                gain & $21dB$ \\
                Noise Figure & $0.9dB$ \\

            \textbf{Table} LNA Specs
        \end{center}

    \subsection{Mixer}
        The only consideration for the mixer is the working frequency. We choose
        the mixer with a working frequency from $400MHz$ to $2GHz$. The
        conversion gain for the mixer is decent at $1GHz$ and the noise figure
        is not so good. Since the cascading system, the system noise figure is
        irrelavant with the last few stages. Because Equ.~\ref{cascading}thus it
        does not matters if the noise figure of the mixer does not matter.

        \end{center}

            \textbf{Table} Mixer Specs
        \end{center}

    \subsection{Oscillators}
        The frequency we choose for the IF is $110MHz$. Thus the oscillator we
        choose can be tuned to that frequency.

        \begin{center}
            \begin{tabular}{c c c}
                Spec & Value \\ \\ \hline \\
